### Current Issues and Potential Solutions
1. The bot relies on ImgFlip's free API, which doesn't support searching for specific meme templates. As a result, it can only generate memes from random templates rather than selecting ones that best match the conversation. (Solution: Upgrade to ImgFlip Premium for advanced search capabilities.)
2. The bot uses LLaMA 3.3, which, while powerful, may generate memes too frequently or produce captions that don't fully align with the context. (Solution: Consider fine-tuning the model to improve relevance and accuracy.)

### Ending Notes
1. Frontend is only HTML, however, completely functional - including websockets, and real time chat meme display.
2. Ongoing project ...

Thanks !
